# Happygit3

Repo to get comfortable with the whole Workflow

## Maybe it's just me

But I am taking the 'leave one line free' markdown instructions
rather serious

## Anyways

 - this is another change from within RStudio

## Oh okay, I was supposed to pull before the push

 - so I can get the updated somebody else might have done
 in the meantime

## So this is another Change

 - this time from the GitHub website

## Yet another change to keep the flow ##

  * This time I will write some more
  * Points
  * Even if it means less sense to be made
      * Indent this one because I've learned my markdown-mode

## This is a section added in the "test_branch"-branch
