# Happygit3

Repo to get comfortable with the whole Workflow

## Maybe it's just me

But I am taking the 'leave one line free' markdown instructions

 - this is another change from within RStudio
 
## Oh okay, I was supposed to pull before the push

 - so I can get the updated somebody else might have done
 in the meantime

## So this is another Change

 - this time from the GitHub website
